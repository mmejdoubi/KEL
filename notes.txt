===============

Installment cash loan: (pret personnel) => plus risky

First few installments are more important than last installments. You know, it’s human nature. When loan applicant late once, he might be late from then. HC will want to make sure loan applicant is always on time from the beginning

Longer loan is always risker than shorter loan. The longer the loan, the higher chance people default will be larger. Therefore, it should be normalized for all loans to be equal (right?)

=======================

x-sell means customers already evaluated risk by previous loans (loans in HC even before previous_application), before giving the loan. This is very valuable feature.
